// Welcome to our Virtual Bookcase program //

After loading our .Java files into your IDE you should be set to run our program

The program will promt you for your name and from there on its as easy as 
	selecting what you would like to do and our program does just that.

After every action our program will return you to our main menu 
	untill you select close program.

After closing it will update your bookcase.txt file with your new books 
	and on your next launch your books will be loaded and ready to view.

We have added a few books into the programs files to get you started 
	but you may remove them by using our remove feature if you feel the need to.

// Have fun! \\
